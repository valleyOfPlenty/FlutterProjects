# FlutterProjects
I was pretty new to github when I made these apps. Here lib is useless, it has mixed code form two apps that I created.
lib1 - refers to the Transaction app (Xpense) that I created. It can keep note of all my monetary activities during a trip.
lib2 - refers to the Auto Analyzer, which help alanysing one's strengths and weaknesses by asking him questions based on several topics such as Logical reasoning, comprehensive ability etc. It also has a calendar which helps you track your own progress and an evaluatory section where a child can grade himself/herself based upon how he performed.
